This project integrates real-time object detection, emotion recognition, and visual animations to create an interactive, fall-themed experience. The system uses YOLO for object detection and DeepFace for emotion analysis, overlaying thematic visuals based on detected objects and emotions.
Key Components:
1. Object Detection with YOLO:
The project employs a YOLO model to detect objects like cups, books, and other cozy items. Detected objects contribute to a “Fall Score” based on their association with a relaxing, autumn atmosphere.
2. Emotion Recognition with DeepFace:
DeepFace analyzes facial expressions to identify emotions such as “happiness” or “neutral.” Detected emotions also contribute to the Fall Score.
3. Fall Score Calculation and Thematic Feedback:
The Fall Score combines object and emotion data to determine if a cozy “Hoa Hoa Hoa Season” message should be displayed, encouraging the user to relax.
4. Animated Falling Leaves:
A visual effect of falling leaves is added, dynamically distributed across the screen to enhance the seasonal theme.

This project showcases how computer vision and deep learning can be combined to create a fun and interactive experience.
